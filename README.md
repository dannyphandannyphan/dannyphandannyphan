- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dannyphandannyphan
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m currently interested in making personal projects that are in some way related to Quantitative Finance!
- ðŸŒ± My current project is learning about the Newton Raphson method of solving functions, I will probably then create a program that uses said method, and then implement with unit tests. 

Projects on the way:
- Natural cubic spline interpolation with unit tests (again!)
- Writing a simulation of a Weiner process and testing its characteristics (mean, drift, etc) and then use it to simulate an option and compare the results to Black Scholes formulae.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me ...
- Email me at zcapdph@ucl.ac.uk, or ndannyphan@gmail.com! I also have a discord: collywobble#4260
