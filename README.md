- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dannyphandannyphan
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m currently interested in making personal projects that are in some way related to Quantitative Finance!
- ðŸŒ± My current project is making a Jupyter Notebook on Newton's method of solving functions, which will take a function as an input and output its solution (if there is one).

Projects on the way:
- Writing a simulation of a Weiner process and testing its characteristics (mean, drift, etc) and then use it to simulate an option and compare the results to Black Scholes formulae.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me ...
- Email me at zcapdph@ucl.ac.uk, or ndannyphan@gmail.com.
