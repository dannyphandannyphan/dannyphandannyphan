- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dannyphandannyphan
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m currently interested in making personal projects that are in some way related to quant finance, software engineering, etc.
- ðŸŒ± My current project is writing a simulation of a wiener process and testing its characteristics (mean, drift, etc) and then use it to simulate an option and compare the results to Black Scholes formulae.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me ...
- Email me at zcapdph@ucl.ac.uk, or ndannyphan@gmail.com.
