- 👋 Hi, I’m @dannyphandannyphan
- 👀 I’m currently interested in making personal projects that are in some way related to quant finance, software engineering, etc.
- 🌱 My current project is writing a simulation of a wiener process and testing its characteristics (mean, drift, etc) and then use it to simulate an option.

- 📫 How to reach me ...
- Email me at zcapdph@ucl.ac.uk, or ndannyphan@gmail.com.
